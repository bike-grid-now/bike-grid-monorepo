# bike-grid-monorepo

## Get Started

This is a javascript / typescript project that uses pnpm, tested with `node v18.8.0 (npm v8.18.0)`. 

To install dependencies, run `pnpm install`.

To run locally, `pnpm --parallel dev`. This will start two services, one for the CMS, and one to view the BikeGridNow static site. Check your terminal output for development URLs.
